## Difference between Taints Tolerations and Selectors


🧱 Taints & Tolerations → The Node decides
* "I don’t allow pods unless they explicitly tolerate me."
* 👉 Node sets a rule (repel policy), pods just say “I can handle that” (toleration).

🎯 Node Selector / Node Affinity → The Pod decides
* "I only want to go to a node that matches my needs."
* 👉 Pod sets a preference or requirement (attraction policy).


  ## Use Cases

  1. Taints & Tolerations -> Node driven Scheduling
     * Purpose: Prevent certain pods from being scheduled on a specific nodes unless they explicitly tolerate the taint.
     * Real World Case:  To avoid scheduling normal workload pods like backend services etc on expensive GPU nodes which is meant for AI/ML workload only.
       
  ```yaml
  kubectl taint nodes gpu-node gpu=ai:NoSchedule
  ```
  2. Node Selectors -> Pod driver scheduling
     * Let say we want to schedule the pods on the basis of environment like QA, Prod etc
       
   ```yaml
  nodeSelector:
    env: production
   ```
